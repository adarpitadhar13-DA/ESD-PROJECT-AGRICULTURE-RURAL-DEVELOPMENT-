# ESD-PROJECT
# Introduction
This project uses machine learning to predict crop yields. By analyzing weather, soil, and historical data, it provides accurate forecasts to help farmers optimize planting, resource allocation, and market strategies. The goal is to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability.
# Features
Machine Learning-based Prediction: Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to accurately forecast crop yields.

Multi-factor Data Analysis: Integrates diverse data sources, including weather, soil conditions, and historical harvest data, for comprehensive analysis.

Decision Support Tool: Provides valuable insights to help farmers make informed decisions about planting and resource management.

Agricultural Optimization: Aims to increase agricultural productivity and sustainability through data-driven strategies.

Open-Source and Collaborative: The repository is structured for transparency, encouraging contributions to improve model accuracy and applicability.
# Dataset
The crop prediction model utilizes the "Crop Recommendation Dataset" obtained from Kaggle. This dataset contains information on various crops, including their nutrient requirements, weather conditions, and other relevant parameters. The dataset has been preprocessed and prepared for training the machine learning model.
# Technology Used
Python
Machine Learning (scikit-learn)
Flask (for web application)
HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for frontend development)
